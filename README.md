# data-scraping-challenge
Armando Cota's homework submission for Module 11
In this challenge we got to work with HTML and data scraping, all while implementing BeautifulSoup.
This challenge was fun! I feel slightly worried that my last graph didn't perfectly match the example we 
were given but I did my best to adjust it to represent the example as best I could. 
Enjoy the code provided. I will most likely be debugging this challenge this upcoming weekend and resubmitting 
depending on how the grading goes.
